SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: EDUCORE DIRECTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Purpose:
This system is a Company Directory platform that allows companies to manage their employees, roles, teams, and hierarchy efficiently. It must handle different role types, hierarchical relationships, and dynamic role combinations.

Key Requirements:
1. User Roles:
   - REGULAR_EMPLOYEE
   - TRAINER
   - TEAM_MANAGER
   - DEPARTMENT_MANAGER
   - DECISION_MAKER
   - Users can have multiple roles simultaneously (e.g., REGULAR_EMPLOYEE + TEAM_MANAGER).

2. Hierarchy:
   - Employees report to a Team Manager.
   - Team Managers report to Department Managers.
   - Department Managers may also be Decision Makers.
   - Employees without management roles are standard users.

3. CSV Upload:
   - Companies register by uploading a CSV file containing employee data.
   - Mandatory fields: employee_id, full_name, email, role(s), team, department, manager_id (optional).
   - If CSV lacks certain data (like manager_id), UI should allow manual input during onboarding.

4. Data Simulation:
   - During development/testing, the system should generate 10–20 sample employees.
   - Sample data must cover all role combinations:
     - REGULAR_EMPLOYEE + TEAM_MANAGER
     - REGULAR_EMPLOYEE + DEPARTMENT_MANAGER
     - TRAINER + DEPARTMENT_MANAGER
     - TRAINER + TEAM_MANAGER
     - REGULAR_EMPLOYEE + DECISION_MAKER + DEPARTMENT_MANAGER
     - Standard employees without management roles

5. Display:
   - Profiles must show role(s) and hierarchical position.
   - Correct hierarchy must be visible on team/department pages.

6. Error Handling:
   - Invalid CSV uploads must be rejected with clear messages.
   - Missing optional fields (like manager_id) should trigger UI prompts.
   - Duplicate employee IDs must be detected.

7. Future Considerations:
   - System will be deployed on cloud for real company use.
   - Roles are dynamic per company but should follow CSV structure.
   - System should be scalable and secure.
